# 🎹 KeybOwOard - 12EDO version // Computer Keyboard Normal Music Keyboard
Many online Music keyboard are available, however, none of them satisfy the important features :
- able to transpose (*without using mouse*)
- able to go up and down in octaves (*without using mouse*)
- intuitive keyboard layout
However, most of the websites out there can't transpose, need a mouse to move between octaves, and some even need to hold SHIFT for black keys *(which is extremely painfull to use)*
And this is why XR_XharpRazor started making this.
<br>
<br>

# 🎯 Main Idea
This is a online Computer Keyboard Music Keyboard such that
- you can transpose
- you can move in between octaves
- setup ADSR
- setup FILTERs
- 4 wave types
all of these can be done on your keyboard, you don't need to reach for your mouse, a.k.a performance-friendly *(performance, like, stage performance, party performance ... not efficiency performance, ... although it is not laggy at all)*
